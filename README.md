# SOLID TAKA

A simple JavaScript code kata which illustrates/violates the single-responsibility principle.

According to SOLID design principles (thank you, Uncle Bob) a class should have only one reason to change.  In this example, we see a simple JavaScript module which violates this principle.

The challenge is two-fold:

-  Identify how/why the principle is violated (hint: it's all in `main.js`).
-  Refactor it to improve its design.

Things to know before starting:

1.  Fork or clone the repo.
2.  Run these files from a folder on your computer in any HTTP server.
  -  Or use app.js in the repo with within NodeJs on your machine.  (No other Node modules are necessary.)
    -  Run `node app` (app.js will start an HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1 for you).
4.  Open http://127.0.0.1 in your browser.
5.  Submit your solution to share with the community.
